I made it for my wife's birthday.
This is based off a "sleepcast" by the app HeadSpace called "Midnight Launderette".
The sleepcast paints a scenario of a weekly visit to a laundromat where you hear the calming whirling of the dryers and the warmth of fresh clothes.
There are other late night patrons that you have come to be familiar with over time, but this time they are more spooky than usual.

Let me know what you think!
